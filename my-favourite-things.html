        <h1>My Favourite things</h1>
        <h3>What are favourite things</h3>
        <p>I consider a favourite thing as to an action or an item that I really like the most for example when talking about my favourite type of movie or my favourite type of drink or my favourite type of music tha I listen to because of late I tend to listen to alot of everything.</p>
        <p>I think favourite things can be a bit biased because sometimes a thing becomes your favourite because of your surrounding or people that you grew up with or because of your experiences with another thing that then makes you prefer something to another thing but thats also alright beacuse these things highlights our diversity of personalities as humans .</p>
        <h4>Some of my favourite things include;</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking coffee and having it with fried eggs for breakfast</li>
            <p>I really dont know why but this combination in the morning is just such a booster for me ,not for all mornings mind you...I could easily get sick of eggs so its reserved for mornings when I feel like that I would need a mood booster. </p>

            <li>Reading a good novel</li>
            <p>Whether hardcopy or sofycopy,I get hard over a good story because stories are imaginative.I prefer to the fiction genre because it encourages the reader to create the worlds inside their heads and be a part of that world.Of late I am reading chinese translated novels .There are many genres including wuxia,xianxia,xianhua which focus on martial arts and others which in them they have different tags like ancient chinese,mecha ,harem etc.To be honest I dont like harem stories ...I mean one man with multiple wives? or one woman with multiple husbands? I mean why?I get that some characters have alot of power and want to spread their seed so that their many generations have some of tha power but I mean??Dont even get me started:(  </p>

            <p>I also love this an author whom goes by the pen name JD.ROBB.She writes the most captivating series of murder-mystery books called the In Death series .Started reding them in high school and now I've got a hard and softcopy collection of all her books.</p>
