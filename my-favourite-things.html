        <h1>My Favourite things</h1>
        <h3>What are favourite things</h3>
        <p>I consider a favourite thing as to an action or an item that I really like the most for example when talking about my favourite type of movie or my favourite type of drink or my favourite type of music tha I listen to because of late I tend to listen to alot of everything.</p>
        <p>I think favourite things can be a bit biased because sometimes a thing becomes your favourite because of your surrounding or people that you grew up with or because of your experiences with another thing that then makes you prefer something to another thing but thats also alright beacuse these things highlights our diversity of personalities as humans .</p>
        <h4>Some of my favourite things include;</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking coffee and having it with fried eggs for breakfast</li>
            <p>I really dont know why but this combination in the morning is just such a booster for me ,not for all mornings mind you...I could easily get sick of eggs so its reserved for mornings when I feel like that I would need a mood booster. </p>

            <li>Reading a good novel</li>
            <p>Whether hardcopy or sofycopy,I get hard over a good story because stories are imaginative.I prefer to the fiction genre because it encourages the reader to create the worlds inside their heads and be a part of that world.<br>Of late I am reading chinese translated novels .There are many genres including wuxia , xianxia, xianhua which focus on martial arts and others which in them they have different tags like ancient chinese,mecha ,harem etc.To be honest I dont like harem stories ...I mean one man with multiple wives? or one woman with multiple husbands? I mean why?I get that some characters have alot of power and want to spread their seed so that their many generations have some of tha power but I mean??Dont even get me started:(  </p>

            <p>I also love an author whom goes by the pen name JD.ROBB.She writes the most captivating series of murder-mystery books called the In Death series .Started reading them in high school and now I've got a hard and softcopy collection of all her books at home.</p>

            <li>Listening to music</li>
            <p>Now when it comes to the topic of music,I sometimes don't know which group I fit in because I listen to most of the genres from hiphop to pop to jazz to RnB to LoFi to EDM to reggae to country music.Music generally is a balm to the soul.It could fill in and make up the soundtracks to our lives.Because most of the times I could relate a section of a period of my life and relate it to a certain song or genre of music that I was listening to very frequently and it would take me back and reflect on it.
          </p><p>I am now listening to this K-pop group called <strong>BTS</strong> and I think they might be it for me. You know those songs that you'll listen to even when you're almost gone ? Yeah that one. Its a band of <em> 7 very talented,charming South Korean men </em> who introduced colour into my life because they literally opened my eyes to many things that I was previously blind to and showed me how to live and love better.To be honest I think finding them was either fate or just luck because I happen to believe in the supernatural...well some bits of it or I could just say that it was a timely coincidence.I still listen to other music now and then but their music is just that..a balm to<em> my </em> soul.I could go on about them but I really need to finish up this project .</p>

          <p>Oh..as I am writing this thay are about to release a new single this month on August 21 called Dynamite ... I am really looking forward to it .</p>

        </ul>
        <p>These are just a smidge of some of my favourite things because I think when I put a bit more effort into thinking about it I'll come up with more than just three. I'll update this list later as I go on.</p>
